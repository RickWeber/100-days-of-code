### R1D0 - 2020-07-27
This is the official start! I just sent out my public commitment tweet.

So, the next 100 days... There's a million things I *want* to do, but if I don't
focus, I'm going to drive myself nuts. So I'm going to focus on my Comparative
Advantage model.

This project serves three main purposes:

1. I've wanted to make this model for a while. That bit of intrinsic motivation
   will help me build momentum.
2. I plan to present this model at NYSEA. That provides some extrinsic
   motivation for the first half of this project.
3. By building the model in Mesa I'll get more hands on experience with python.
   Despite spending plenty of time using Python, it still feels foreign because
   I haven't built anything substantial in it.

So here's my plan:
Over the next 100 days, I'm going to develop my currently scattered thoughts
into a Python program using the Mesa library. This program will be an agent
based model where agents produce and trade with each other. The intention is to
demonstrate the idea of comparative advantage. Ideally the program should be:
* easy to explain/understand,
* open ended enough that a) I'm not imposing conclusions, and b) novel behavior
  can emerge in an unplanned manner,
* clean enough that I can use something like numba to speed up the model and
  allow it to be scaled up to generate large experiments
* general enough that I can add layers of complexity to it, or use it to
  underlie a different economic model.

For the time being, I'm going to start this project fresh in this git repo. As
it develops enough to stand on its own feet, I'll move it into its own repo.
